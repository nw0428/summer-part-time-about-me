		<h1>Tara Mathur</h1>

		<p>I grew up near Boston and then headed to the West Coast for college.  Afterwards I joined a company called <a href="http://www.factset.com" target="_blank">FactSet</a>: first coding, then managing client accounts, and finally managing one of the core products.  I also had a side labor of love teaching Silicon Valley folks how to relax.</p>

		After getting married I moved to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/25/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-indianapolis-indiana.html?_r=0" alt-"Indianapolis">Midwest</a>.  I did a couple of digital marketing gigs while I was there.  Then I had my daughter Indira.</p>

		<p>I'm now back in Boston and excited to plug into the Boston tech community.  My 3 favorite things to do: <a href="http://www.hongkongharvard.com" alt=The Kong>dancing like a maniac to 80s music</a>, nerding out over crossword puzzles, and watching travel shows.</p>
