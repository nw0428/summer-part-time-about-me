      <h2>An Abridged History</h2>

      <p>
        I was born in Milford, MA.
      </p>

      <p>
        I grew up.
      </p>

      <p>
         After growing up, I lived a couple of other places, including Schenectady, NY where I went to Union College. I have a degree in Physics that I don't really use anymore; but I did make the background of this page space, so that's something.
      </p>

      <p>
        I moved back to Boston a couple of years ago when my current company, ezCater, hired me. I started off writing copy for the site; but then I realized that I like coding, so I did a bunch of online tutorials, and now I work in direct support.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time, I decompress by watching sci-fi series while I knit things from those series. Recently, I started selling my stuff on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/KnitInAMeeting/" target="_blank">Etsy</a> to fund my yarn habit.
